# CVDA

## Control via Discord Application

Have you ever been lying in bed or away from home and wished you could control your PC — like shutting it down — without complicated apps or unreliable tools?  
**CVDA** makes it simple, using the power of Discord to give you remote access without any unnecessary bloat.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

CVDA connects to your computer through a custom Discord bot that listens for specific commands you send. The program automatically compiles itself into an executable and places it in the system startup folder, ensuring it runs every time your PC boots.  
*(If you prefer to disable this, simply change `STARTUP=True` to `STARTUP=False` in the configuration.)*

## 🔐 Privacy & Usage

This tool is designed for **personal use**. Avoid using it in servers where untrusted users may have access. For maximum safety and control, it's recommended to run CVDA on a private Discord server where only you and the bot are present.
