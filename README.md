# CVDA

## Control via Discord Application

Have you ever been lying in bed or away from home and wished you could control your PC ‚Äî like shutting it down ‚Äî without complicated apps or unreliable tools?  
**CVDA** makes it simple, using the power of Discord to give you remote access without any unnecessary bloat.

## üöÄ How It Works

CVDA connects to your computer through a custom Discord bot that listens for specific commands you send. The program automatically compiles itself into an executable and places it in the system startup folder, ensuring it runs every time your PC boots.  
*(If you prefer to disable this, simply change `STARTUP=True` to `STARTUP=False` in the compile.py file.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage Guide

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Setup a discord bot, follow the tutorial [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html).
3. Open the `CVDA.py` file.
    - Insert your Discord bot token.
    - Insert your server ID in the guild_id variable.
    - Set the path to your preferred browser.
4. Open the `compile.py` file.
    - Set `STARTUP=False` if you do not want the bot to run on startup.
5. Run the provided `.bat` file to execute the compiler.
6. Monitor the compiler messages for any errors.
    - Ensure the compiled `.exe` has been moved to the startup folder if requested.
7. Check if your Discord bot is online.
    - If not, you can run the `.exe` manually.
8. Start sending commands to your bot using the slash commands.
    - Example: `/shutdown` or `/web youtube.com`
9. Note: Slash commands may not appear immediately due to discord's weird thing with slash commands, so wait at least 20 minutes before contacting me about an issue.

## üîê Privacy & Usage

This tool is designed for **personal use**. Avoid using it in servers where untrusted users may have access. For maximum safety and control, it's recommended to run CVDA on a private Discord server where only you and the bot are present.
